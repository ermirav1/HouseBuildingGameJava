# HouseBuildingGame

Project 6.11.7

Use the class from the previous exercise to build a game called “draw the house.”
The objective is to throw a die repeatedly, and based on the outcome, draw parts
of a house. A throw of 6 lets one draw the building, a square; a throw of 5 lets
one draw the roof; a throw of 4 lets one draw the door; and a throw of 3 lets one
draw a window. (There are two windows.)
  
Of course, the building must be drawn before the roof, and the roof must be
drawn before the doors and windows.
In addition to the class that represents the die, write a model class that represents the state of a partially built house. Then, write an output view that
displays the house, and write a controller that enforces the rules of the game.
